# The gkcodecs library contains code from third-party libraries implementing
# encoding an decoding for particular audio and video codecs.
#
# They are compiled in a separate shared library to be able to be available
# both from libxul (when decoding using the codec integration layer Gecko
# provides) and from ffmpeg (when decoding and encoding through ffmpeg).
