* released 0.4

2010-05-08
* reorganize code to remove circular imports

2010-05-07
* Ensure that __special__ method lookups don't cause config attributes
  to be added.

2010-05-06
* Fix problems with pickling INIConfig objects.  This also fixes
  multiprocessing problems.

* released 0.3.0

2009-02-22
* Make INIConfig objects pickle-able

  multi-line values - empty lines are stripped on parsing,
  but preserved when the value is explicitly set.

2009-02-10
* Skip DEFAULT section when listing sections (issue 8)

2009-02-03
* Bugfixes for continuation line behavior, based on patch by
  sidnei.da.silva - (1) preserve empty lines in multi-line
  values, and (2) fix assignment to multi-line values

2008-12-06
* released 0.2.4

2008-12-06
* upgraded test_compat to the tests included with python-2.6.1
* fixed compatibility warnings generated by the '-3' option
* Python's ConfigParser has acquired the ability to use custom dict
  types - presumably to support user-controlled ordering.  This
  feature does not seem to make sense in the context of iniparse,
  so I'm not planning on adding support for it (unless I hear
  otherwise from users).

2008-12-05
* add hack to fix unicode support on python-2.4.x
* use the built-in set() type instead of the pre-2.4 sets module
