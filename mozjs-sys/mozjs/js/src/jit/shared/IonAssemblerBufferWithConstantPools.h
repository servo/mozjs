// [SMDOC] JIT AssemblerBuffer constant pooling (ARM/ARM64/RISCV64)
//
// This code extends the AssemblerBuffer to support the pooling of values loaded
// using program-counter relative addressing modes. This is necessary with the
// ARM instruction set because it has a fixed instruction size that can not
// encode all values as immediate arguments in instructions. Pooling the values
// allows the values to be placed in large chunks which minimizes the number of
// forced branches around them in the code. This is used for loading floating
// point constants, for loading 32 bit constants on the ARMv6, for absolute
// branch targets, and in future will be needed for large branches on the ARMv6.
//
// For simplicity of the implementation, the constant pools are always placed
// after the loads referencing them. When a new constant pool load is added to
// the assembler buffer, a corresponding pool entry is added to the current
// pending pool. The finishPool() method copies the current pending pool entries
// into the assembler buffer at the current offset and patches the pending
// constant pool load instructions.
//
// Before inserting instructions or pool entries, it is necessary to determine
// if doing so would place a pending pool entry out of reach of an instruction,
// and if so then the pool must firstly be dumped. With the allocation algorithm
// used below, the recalculation of all the distances between instructions and
// their pool entries can be avoided by noting that there will be a limiting
// instruction and pool entry pair that does not change when inserting more
// instructions. Adding more instructions makes the same increase to the
// distance, between instructions and their pool entries, for all such
// pairs. This pair is recorded as the limiter, and it is updated when new pool
// entries are added, see updateLimiter()
//
// The pools consist of: a guard instruction that branches around the pool, a
// header word that helps identify a pool in the instruction stream, and then
// the pool entries allocated in units of words. The guard instruction could be
// omitted if control does not reach the pool, and this is referred to as a
// natural guard below, but for simplicity the guard branch is always
// emitted. The pool header is an identifiable word that in combination with the
// guard uniquely identifies a pool in the instruction stream. The header also
// encodes the pool size and a flag indicating if the guard is natural. It is
// possible to iterate through the code instructions skipping or examining the
// pools. E.g. it might be necessary to skip pools when search for, or patching,
// an instruction sequence.
//
// The code supports no-pool regions, and for these the size of the region, in
// instructions, must be supplied. This size is used to determine if inserting
// the instructions would place a pool entry out of range, and if so then a pool
// is firstly flushed. The DEBUG code checks that the emitted code is within the
// supplied size to detect programming errors. See enterNoPool() and
// leaveNoPool().

// The only planned instruction sets that require inline constant pools are the
// ARM, ARM64, RISCV64 (and historically MIPS), and these all have fixed 32-bit
// sized instructions so for simplicity the code below is specialized for fixed
// 32-bit sized instructions and makes no attempt to support variable length
// instructions. The base assembler buffer which supports variable width
// instruction is used by the x86 and x64 backends.

// The AssemblerBufferWithConstantPools template class uses static callbacks to
// the provided Asm template argument class:
//
// void Asm::InsertIndexIntoTag(uint8_t* load_, uint32_t index)
//
//   When allocEntry() is called to add a constant pool load with an associated
//   constant pool entry, this callback is called to encode the index of the
//   allocated constant pool entry into the load instruction.
//
//   After the constant pool has been placed, PatchConstantPoolLoad() is called
//   to update the load instruction with the right load offset.
//
// void Asm::WritePoolGuard(BufferOffset branch,
//                          Instruction* dest,
//                          BufferOffset afterPool)
//
//   Write out the constant pool guard branch before emitting the pool.
//
//   branch
//     Offset of the guard branch in the buffer.
//
//   dest
//     Pointer into the buffer where the guard branch should be emitted. (Same
//     as getInst(branch)). Space for guardSize_ instructions has been reserved.
//
//   afterPool
//     Offset of the first instruction after the constant pool. This includes
//     both pool entries and branch veneers added after the pool data.
//
// void Asm::WritePoolHeader(uint8_t* start, Pool* p, bool isNatural)
//
//   Write out the pool header which follows the guard branch.
//
// void Asm::PatchConstantPoolLoad(void* loadAddr, void* constPoolAddr)
//
//   Re-encode a load of a constant pool entry after the location of the
//   constant pool is known.
//
//   The load instruction at loadAddr was previously passed to
//   InsertIndexIntoTag(). The constPoolAddr is the final address of the
//   constant pool in the assembler buffer.
//
// void Asm::PatchShortRangeBranchToVeneer(AssemblerBufferWithConstantPools*,
//                                         unsigned rangeIdx,
//                                         BufferOffset deadline,
//                                         BufferOffset veneer)
//
//   Patch a short-range branch to jump through a veneer before it goes out of
//   range.
//
//   rangeIdx, deadline
//     These arguments were previously passed to registerBranchDeadline(). It is
//     assumed that PatchShortRangeBranchToVeneer() knows how to compute the
//     offset of the short-range branch from this information.
//
//   veneer
//     Space for a branch veneer, guaranteed to be <= deadline. At this
//     position, guardSize_ * InstSize bytes are allocated. They should be
//     initialized to the proper unconditional branch instruction.
//
//   Unbound branches to the same unbound label are organized as a linked list:
//
//     Label::offset -> Branch1 -> Branch2 -> Branch3 -> nil
//
//   This callback should insert a new veneer branch into the list:
//
//     Label::offset -> Branch1 -> Branch2 -> Veneer -> Branch3 -> nil
//
//   When Assembler::bind() rewrites the branches with the real label offset, it
//   probably has to bind Branch2 to target the veneer branch instead of jumping
//   straight to the label.

// structure does not care about the actual range of branch instructions, just
// the latest buffer offset that can be reached - the deadline offset.
