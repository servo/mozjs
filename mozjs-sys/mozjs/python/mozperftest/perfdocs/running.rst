Running a performance test
==========================

Running locally
---------------

Running a test is as simple as calling it using `mach perftest` in a mozilla-central source
checkout::

    $ ./mach perftest

The `mach` command will bootstrap the installation of all required tools for the
framework to run, and display a selection screen to pick a test. Once the
selection is done, the performance test will run locally.

If you know what test you want to run, you can use its path explicitly::

    $ ./mach perftest perftest_script.js

`mach perftest` comes with numerous options, and the test script should provide
decent defaults, so you don't need to adjust them. If you need to tweak some
options, you can use `./mach perftest --help` to learn about them.


Running in the CI
-----------------
