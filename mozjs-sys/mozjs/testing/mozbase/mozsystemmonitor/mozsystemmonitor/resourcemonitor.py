class SystemResourceMonitor:
    """Measures system resources.

    Each instance measures system resources from the time it is started
    until it is finished. It does this on a separate process so it doesn't
    impact execution of the main Python process.

    Each instance is a one-shot instance. It cannot be used to record multiple
    durations.

    Aside from basic data gathering, the class supports basic analysis
    capabilities. You can query for data between ranges. You can also tell it
    when certain events occur and later grab data relevant to those events or
    plot those events on a timeline.

    The resource monitor works by periodically polling the state of the
    system. By default, it polls every second. This can be adjusted depending
    on the required granularity of the data and considerations for probe
    overhead. It tries to probe at the interval specified. However, variations
    should be expected. Fast and well-behaving systems should experience
    variations in the 1ms range. Larger variations may exist if the system is
    under heavy load or depending on how accurate socket polling is on your
    system.

    In its current implementation, data is not available until collection has
    stopped. This may change in future iterations.

    Usage
    =====

    monitor = SystemResourceMonitor()
    monitor.start()

    # Record that a single event in time just occurred.

    # Record that we're about to perform a possibly long-running event.
    with monitor.phase('long_job'):
        foo.do_long_running_job()

    # Stop recording. Currently we need to stop before data is available.
    monitor.stop()

    # Obtain the raw data for the entire probed range.
