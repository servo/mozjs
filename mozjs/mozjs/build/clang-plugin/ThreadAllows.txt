# This file is ingested by `ThreadAllows.py` to produce a list of thread names
# which our clang plugin will allow to be used with `NS_NewNamedThread`.
#
# Permitted thread names are a maximum of 15 characters in length, and must be
# string literals at their point-of-use in the code -- i.e., in the invocation
# of `NS_NewNamedThread`.
#
# Within this file, each permitted thread name is on a separate line. Comments
# begin with `#`, as seen here. Leading and trailing whitespace, trailing
# comments, and blank lines are ignored, and may be used freely.
#
# Please explain the addition of any new thread names in comments, preferably
# with a pointer to a relevant bug. (Do not add thread names only used in tests
# to this file; instead, add the test file to `ThreadFileAllows.txt`.)

# Gecko/Firefox thread names
# (See also "Unsorted thread names", below.)

# Used by `nsUpdateProcessor` to check for updates. May also be used for polling
# the update process.

# Unsorted thread names
#
# Thread names below this point are grandfathered in. Please do not add new
# thread names to this list -- and please remove any that you can, whether by
# documenting and moving them or by confirming that they are no longer required.
#
# In particular, if a thread name is only used for testing, please consider
# moving its declarator to `ThreadFileAllows.txt`.
