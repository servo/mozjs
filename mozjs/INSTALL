Documentation for SpiderMonkey is available at:

  https://spidermonkey.dev/

In particular, it points to build documentation at

  https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/js/build.html

Note that the libraries produced by the build system include symbols,
causing the binaries to be extremely large. It is highly suggested that `strip`
be run over the binaries before deploying them.

Building with default options may be performed as follows:

  ./mach build

This will produce a debug build (much more suitable for developing against the
SpiderMonkey JSAPI). To produce an optimized build:

  export MOZCONFIG=$(pwd)/mozconfig.opt
  ./mach build

You may edit the mozconfig and mozconfig.opt files to configure your own build
appropriately.
